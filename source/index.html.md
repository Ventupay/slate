```


# Platform vs API Functionalities

At EFEX, we want to give you the best product experience. Hence, we offer both a platform where you and your entire team can excecute transactions manually, and a comprehensvie API (connected to your platform) where you can automate with code all your operations. 

Our platform includes the following features:

- Instructions to add funds to your EFEX wallet
- Withdrawal of funds from your EFEX wallet
- Visibility of exchange rates between currencies
- Creation of contacts
- Payments out (Send payments)
- Payments in (Request payments) **Currently to other EFEX users
- Payment receipts
- Monthly statements
- Add and remove members to your EFEX account


Our API includes the following functionalities:

- Instructions to add funds to your EFEX wallet
- Visibility of exchange rates between currencies
- Creation of contacts
- Payments out (Send payments)


# Instructions to Add Funds

In order to carry out an operation, we first need to load funds into your EFEX wallet. This must be done from your company's bank account to your EFEX wallet in the corresponding country.

<aside class="notice">
Warning: it is important that the funds come from the bank account registered in the onboarding so that we can identify the funds internally in EFEX.
</aside>

Deposit methods that we accept:

- United States (USD): domestic wires (we don't accept ACH)
- Mexico (MXN): SPEI
- Colombia (COP): PSE

<aside class="notice">
Warning: if I register as a US company, I can only add funds within the US
</aside>


# Exchange rates

At any time, you can query via API the exchange rates between the different currencies that we support:

USD/MXN
<br>
USD/COP
<br>
MXN/USD
<br>
USD/COP
<br>
COP/USD
<br>
COP/MXN

It is important to keep in mind that the exchange rates are informative in order to know the market prices that EFEX currently offers. However, to carry out a currency conversion, it is necessary to execute the "Payments Out" API that includes the FX (the conversion) plus the local dispersion to the destination bank.

# Contact Creation

The creation of contacts is a process by which your company can generate end beneficiaries for transfers in the countries of destination. Contacts can be persons or businesses. For the creation of contacts we need the following data depending on the country.

Attribute | Type | Description | Example
--------- | ------- | ----------- | -----------
id | UUID | the id of the Contact | a9d0164d-22df-46c6-a836-1a3da5a470d8

phone | String | Phone Number of the Contact | 6505056442

tax_number | TaxNumber | tax number of the contact for the country provided | 128412312
first_name | String | First name of the Contact | Santiago
last_name | String | Last name of the Contact | Bustamante Villa

bank_name | String | the name of the banking institution | JP Morgan


# Payments Out

With the endpoint of "Payments Out" you can make all conversions and dispersions internationally. In order to send a payment we need to identify with the email a beneficiary previously created with the "Contacts" endpoint. With the "client_uuid" of that contact you will be able to call this "payload" to carry out the transaction and automatically send the funds.
